1. Evaluate and Tune Models: Perform hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation for the best-performing models (Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting).
2. Regularization: Apply regularization to Logistic Regression to see if it improves generalization.
3. Ensemble Techniques: Experiment with ensemble methods like bagging (Random Forest) and boosting (Gradient Boosting) to enhance model performance.
4. Feature Engineering: Explore new features and transformations that might help capture the underlying patterns better.
5. Model Validation: Ensure robust evaluation by using techniques like cross-validation and hold-out validation sets.
6. Monitoring and Iteration: Continuously monitor model performance and iterate on the approach based on validation results.
